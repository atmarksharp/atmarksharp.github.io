Doubler
-------

This plugin is a fully working example of how to create a VST plugin with 
an editor in Delphi. The Delphi VST SDK is included.
The effect is very simple: it multiplies the incoming signal with a certain
factor. This way, it acts as a gain control.
Note that the editor window doesn't receive keyboard focus. If anyone knows 
how to achieve this, please let me know.
