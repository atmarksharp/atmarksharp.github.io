<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are two ways to create an effect. Either you 
  use the AEffect record directly, or you create a new class which descends from 
  AudioEffect. The first way is troublesome and I don't really see an advantage 
  to it. So here I'll concentrate on creating your own effect class.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an example project which demonstrates what 
  is explained here. You can <a HREF="dexample.zip">download it</a>.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of methods in AudioEffect. To build 
  a basic plugin, you only need to override seven of them. These are the constructor, 
  Process(), getParameterLabel, getParameterDisplay, getParameterName, getParameter 
  and setParameter. To see how to override the constructor and what to do in your 
  own version, see the example project (uExampleEffect.pas). Processing and parameters 
  are described later. Here I want to explain some of the things to do in the 
  overridden constructor.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>setProgram(0); </b><br>
  This sets the current program to the first. Programs are explained later.<br>
  <br>
  <b>setNumInputs(1); </b><br>
  Like I said, a plugin processes audio data. For this, it needs inputs and outputs. 
  You can define any number of inputs, but the most used are 1 and 2. The number 
  of inputs and outputs determines wether your plugin is considered a Master effect 
  or not by Cubase. The number of inputs and outputs is also important in the 
  Process() and ProcessReplacing methods, explained later.<br>
  <br>
  <b>setNumOutputs(2);</b> <br>
  This sets the number of outputs.<br>
  <br>
  <b>hasVu(TRUE);</b> <br>
  Set this to true to tell the host you have a VU. I don't know if this is implemented 
  in Cubase.<br>
  <br>
  <b>canProcessReplacing(TRUE);</b> <br>
  Set this to true if you do some processing in ProcessReplacing() as well, and 
  not just in Process().<br>
  <br>
  <b>setUniqueID(FourCharToLong('E', 'x', 'm', 'E'));</b> <br>
  You need to fill in four letters to give your plugin a unique id. Cubase uses 
  this to tell plugins apart, so it's VERY important.<br>
  <br>
  <b>suspend;</b> <br>
  Calling suspend in the constructor might be necessary, depending on what you 
  do in Suspend().<br>
  <br>
  <b>StrCopy(programName, 'Default');</b> <br>
  You need to initialize the program name.<br>
