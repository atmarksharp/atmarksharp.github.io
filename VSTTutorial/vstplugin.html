<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of Cubase or any other VST host, a VST 
  plugin is a dynamic link library (dll) which exports one function called <a HREF="main.html">main</a>. 
  This function creates an effect, represented by a record of type AEffect. The 
  record gives access to data and functions needed to use the effect.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the developer of a plugin, it is also a dll which 
  exports a main function. It is also an AEffect record or an AudioEffect class, 
  depending on the choice he makes. The AudioEffect class is a wrapper around 
  the AEffect record. It makes it easier for the developer to add the functionality 
  he wants to give to the effect, without having to wonder about the things that 
  are the same for all plugins.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A VST plugin has two main features: it allows the host 
  to inquire about its <a HREF="parameters.html">parameters</a> and have them 
  changed by the user, and it accepts audio data from the host, does something 
  to it and gives back the result. Optionally, it also provides its own <a HREF="editor.html">editor</a> 
  to edit its parameters. This way, the user can change the parameters in the 
  manner which is most appropriate.</p>
